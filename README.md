this bin file is for an esp32 CYD, loaded from launcher. It is unreliable in that it completes less then 50% of the time.  when it does it will display "Your Mouse/keyboard fails security test"  

it is based on code from insecurityofthings and with the help of joelsernamoreno to point me in the right direction of using the arduinoiIDE instead of Platformio to compile it.
